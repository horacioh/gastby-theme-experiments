This example blog is generated with [Gatsby][] and the [@jxnblk/gatsby-theme-mdx-blog][] theme.
The theme generates a blog with MDX or markdown content.

## Isolated styles

The styles used in this theme are isolated to the pages generated by this theme,
which means other pages in your site can have completely different styles.
The styles are generated using [Emotion][], [Styled System][], [theme-ui][] and [@styled-system/css][].
This theme also supports color modes.
You can click the button in the header at the top of this page to cycle through different color schemes.

Colors and typography styles are completely customizable using Gatsby's [shadowing feature][].
